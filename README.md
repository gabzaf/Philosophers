# Philosophers

This project is part of the 42 curriculum and aims to teach the basics of threading a process. In this project, you created threads and discover mutexes.

## Introduction

The Philosophers project is a classic synchronization problem involving philosophers who are thinking and eating at a table with forks. The goal is to avoid deadlock and ensure that each philosopher can eventually eat.

## Usage

To run the philosophers program, execute the following command:

`$ ./philosophers [number_of_philosophers] [time_to_die] [time_to_eat] [time_to_sleep] [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat (optional)]`
